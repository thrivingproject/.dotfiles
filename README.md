# dotfiles (~/.)

This repo is used in conjunction with [devcontainers](https://www.github.com/devcontainers) to setup a development environment. The dotfiles are used to configure the shell and other tools. It can also be used when resetting or replacing a personal computer.

## Setup

Clone this repo and run the `setup.sh` script.

```bash
git clone
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

## Local VSCode devcontainer
